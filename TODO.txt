Todo (bug solutions):
    Game mechanics :
        Inventory checks :
            - display message if can't afford : use ui.disp_print()
                ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
        Items selection menu:
            - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter if it has an Item Selection Menu:
                Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message)
        Player_move :
            - must check if next room has a wall after room selection in case player
                re-enters selection menu from an other door => cannot enter if wall but can choose room
            - call player.move() on current position when cancelling room_selection()
                to actualise door_status on display if it was unlocked before room_selection()
            Optionnal :
            - use door values :
                -1 for opened_door, -2 for front_door (or else we have a planted_pot on the display)
                => need to set doors to opened_door on both sides
                Note : can change values => report changes in main_screen.py -> blit_status()
    UI :
        - Selection Menu for items



Bugs :
    - Chapel can't be choosen
        ?
    - Can go through wall if room_choice made and re-enter room_choice from an other door
        see Game mechanics/Player_move/1st
    - When cancelling room_choice : ui doesn't actualise door state (remains locked)
        see Game mechanics/Player_move/2nd
    - When opening 2_lock door -> cost == 1 key instead of 2

Improvements :
    - Front door is a potted plant : weird => see Game mechanics/Player_move/Optionnal/1st
