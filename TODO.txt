Todo (bug solutions):
    Game mechanics :
        Inventory checks :
            - display message if can't afford : use ui.disp_print()
                ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
        Items selection menu:
            - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter if it has an Item Selection Menu:
                Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message)
        Player_move :
            - must check if next room has a wall after room selection in case player
                re-enters selection menu from an other door => cannot enter if wall but can choose room
    UI :
        - Issue with disp_print on menus 
            -> will need to call a quit() function to exit menus



Bugs :
    - Bug with Chapel : sometimes can't be chosen
        why ?
    - Can go through wall if room_choice made and re-enter room_choice from an other door
        see Game mechanics/Player_move/1st
    - When opening 2_lock door -> cost == 1 key instead of 2
