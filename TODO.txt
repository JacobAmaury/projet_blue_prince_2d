To implement:
    Player enters Shop/Explore :
        - see ui for nav implementation (similar to select_room)

    Room messages :
        - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter (if Shop/Explore available):
            Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message) (see Player class)
            (Note : Screen is updated on player.move())
        - can also be used to display room effects

    Room choice when cancelling choice and re-opening from an other door:
        - Solution 1 (implemented) : rotate rooms in choice to match
            => what happens if open multiple doors before choice ? (Should match all opened doors)
            => what happens if no match found ? (Solution : Game over : Tou broke the manor)
        (- Solution 2 : can choose room but cannot enter if wall)

	UI : Game over/You won screens

Bugs:
	- 2_Locked_doors still opened with 1 key
	- When choosing 'Chapel' : obscure message if not enough coins
