To implement :
    - Lucky rabbit
    - win/lose

Bugs :
    - room.messages not reset after Enter is pressed
        => call check_room_actions() in 'space' event handler ?
        Shouldn't check_room_actions() be a Room method ? (using player.current_room to get the room)

    - Should be able to Press Enter to re-open explore if there are remaining items
