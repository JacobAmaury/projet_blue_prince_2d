Game mechanics :
    Inventory checks :
        - display message if can't afford : use ui.disp_print)
            ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
    Player_move :
        - must check if next room has a wall after room selection in case player
            re-enters selection menu from an other door => cannot enter if wall but can choose room

        Optionnal :
        - call player.move() on current position when cancelling room_selection()
            to actualise door_status on display if it was unlocked before room_selection()
        - use door values :
            -1 for opened_door, -2 for front_door (or else we have a planted_pot on the display)
            => need to set doors to opened_door on both sides
            Note : can change values => report changes in main_screen.py -> blit_status()
    
UI :
    - Selection Menu for items
