Todo (bug solutions):
    Game mechanics :
        Inventory checks :
            - display message if can't afford : use ui.disp_print()
                ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
        Items selection menu:
            - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter if it has an Item Selection Menu:
                Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message)
        Player_move :
            - must check if next room has a wall after room selection in case player
                re-enters selection menu from an other door => cannot enter if wall but can choose room
    UI :
        - Position on disp_print on menus to improve
