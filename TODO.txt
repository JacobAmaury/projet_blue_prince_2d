To implement:
        Player enters Shop/Explore :
            - see ui for nav implementation (similar to select_room)

        Display messages :
            - display messages with ui.screen.print()
                ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
            - display messages in menus with <menu>(args, print_msg)

        Room messages :
            - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter (if Shop/Explore available):
                Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message)
		(Note : Screen is updated on player.move())
            - can also be used to display room effects

        Room choice when cancelling choice and re-openning from an other door:
            - Solution 1 : cannot enter if wall but can still choose room
            - Solution 2 (implmented) : rotate rooms in choice to match
		=> what happens if open multiple doors before choice ? (Should match all opened doors)
		=> what happens if no match found ? (Solution : Game over : Tou broke the manor)

	UI : Game over/You won screen

Bugs:
	- 2_Locked_doors still opened with 1 key
	- When choosing 'Chapel' : obscure message if not enough coins
