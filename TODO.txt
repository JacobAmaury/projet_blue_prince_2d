Todo (bug solutions):
    Game mechanics :
        Display messages :
            - display messages with ui.screen.print()
                ex: Nav.ui.disp_print("Can't open door : Not enough keys !")
            - display messages in menus with <menu>(args, print_msg)
        Room message:
            - Rooms must display a message to invite to press Enter:
                Can be done by setting player.message with the message (None if no message)
        Player_move :
            - must check if next room has a wall after room selection in case player
                re-enters selection menu from an other door => cannot enter if wall but can choose room
